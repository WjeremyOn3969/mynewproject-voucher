# mynewproject-voucher
I have just ventured into a new hobby with an interest in building projects. I have always wanted to do this for a long time, but didn't have the right time and opportunity to deepen my skills and knowledge, and showcase something that I can be proud of. Below is one of such Projects, and from time to time, I will upload and share my projects that I built.

This mini-project involves an Excel CSV file that gives insights into different age groups and genders who receive their vouchers either via the voucher platform or by coupon.
Power BI is used to visualize the statistics of the distribution of government vouchers received by age group and gender.
